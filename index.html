    <p>Howdy, welcome to my personal website!
        I am from Houston, Texas and am very passionate about programming and problem solving.
        I am a rising junior at TAMU and am Class of 2025 (AY AY AY WHOOP!), and I hope to become a software engineer once I graduate.
        I love to run, code, read and play pickleball. My family is originally from Brazil, so we speak Portuguese
        as well as English at home. My older sister also went to TAMU!<br> <br>
            A few fun facts: <br>
            - I'm a big cat person and hope to have my own cat someday <br>
            - My favorite book is <i>Never Let Me Go</i> by Kazuo Ishiguro. <br>
            - The high school I went to is across the street from Minute Maid Stadium (Go 'Stros!) <br>
            - I hope to run a full marathon or even do an Iron Man one day. <br><br>
        <b>Thank you</b> for visiting my website! I hope it's an enjoyable experience and provides some insight into
        who I am and what my goals are. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me for any reason at all! <br>
